# 8-Puzzle 

## 🎯 Overview
This project visualizes the **A\*** search algorithm solving the 8-puzzle problem.

- `solver.py` → contains our A* algorithm.
- `gui.py` → provides an interactive Tkinter GUI.
- The GUI starts with first test case board (`724506831`) by default. But you may change it up if you want.
