# 8-Puzzle A* Solver Visualization

## 🎯 Overview
This project visualizes the **A\*** search algorithm solving the 8-puzzle problem.

- `solver.py` → contains your A* algorithm (unchanged).
- `gui.py` → provides an interactive Tkinter GUI.
- The GUI starts with first test case board (`724506831`) by default. But you maye change it up if you want.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Uses only built-in libraries: `tkinter`, `heapq`, `threading`, and `random`.

### Steps
1. Place both files (`solver.py`, `gui.py`) in the same directory.
2. Run:
    ```bash
   python gui.py
